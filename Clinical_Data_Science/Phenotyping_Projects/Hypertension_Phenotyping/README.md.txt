# Hypertension Phenotyping Project

## Clinical Problem
Hypertension is frequently under- or misclassified in EHR data due to
variability in blood pressure recordings and coding.

## Objective
To develop a rule-based phenotyping algorithm to identify hypertensive
patients from structured clinical data.

## Data Source
De-identified EHR data (BP measurements, diagnosis codes).

## Phenotype Logic
- Systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg on more than two occasions OR
- Diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg on more than two occasions OR
- Presence of hypertension-related diagnosis codes

## Validation
Phenotype results were compared against a gold standard dataset.

## Tools Used
SQL, Excel, PowerPoint

## Status
Completed
