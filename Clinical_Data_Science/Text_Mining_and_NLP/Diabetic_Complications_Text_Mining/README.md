# Diabetic Complications – Clinical Text Mining

## Clinical Problem
Diabetic complications are often documented in unstructured clinical
notes, making automated identification challenging.

## Objective
To identify and classify diabetic complications from clinical text
using keyword-based text mining.

## Data Source
De-identified clinical notes used for academic analysis.

## Methodology
- Keyword and pattern matching
- Rule-based text mining
- Manual validation of extracted terms

## Outcome
The approach successfully identified common diabetic complications
such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy.

## Tools Used
R, Excel, PowerPoint

## Status
